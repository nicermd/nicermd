# Backlog

Living log of deferred work. Bugs go in `KNOWN-ISSUES.md`; future-roadmap
items go in user memory (`project_direction.md`). This file tracks
mid-grain follow-ups that aren't worth a fresh issue but shouldn't be
forgotten.

## Open URL

- **Streaming size guard.** The 5 MiB cap currently buffers the whole
  response before checking — an attacker-controlled server could ship
  the first 4.99 MiB then keep writing. Replace with a streaming reader
  that aborts as soon as bytes-read exceeds the cap. Defensive only;
  current cap is enough in practice.

- **Default-branch lookup via api.github.com.** Bare-repo URLs currently
  try `main` then fall back to `master`. Correct in 99% of public repos,
  wrong for `develop` / `trunk` / project-specific defaults. Adds a CSP
  entry (`api.github.com`) and an extra round-trip; current heuristic
  is the right trade for a spike.

## Fonts

- **"More fonts" affordance.** Custom URL field or full Google Fonts
  catalogue search inside the font picker. Current 10/5 catalogue
  covers the common pairings; defer until dogfood signal says
  otherwise.
- **Bundled WOFF2s for desktop / mobile.** Tauri offline currently
  falls back to system fonts. Bundling the catalogue increases install
  size; revisit when Tauri/iOS distribution actually ships.
